# Recursive Disassembler (Work-In-Progress)  

This Semester, I am taking a course in Binary Program Analysis. For the first project, I plan to write a Recursive Descent Disassembler for ELF files in python using the Capstone Library. I will update this post with my progress, and cool things I learn along the way.
