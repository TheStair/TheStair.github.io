I am a college student with an academic and career interest in cybersecurity. I specifically enjoy Software Reverse Engineering, Digital Forensics, Incident Response, and Network Security!

I currently work in undergraduate research and am in leadership at my University's Cybersecurity Club

On this website, I will post my thoughts and writeups for cyber competitions and puzzles, and I will make posts about projects I am currently working on.
